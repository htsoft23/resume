<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I started to learn Web developing in 2024, taking Udemy's The Complete 2024
  Web Development Bootcamp course.
</p>

<p>
  So far only making these very simple html pages, learning the basics: text
  formatting elements, links, inserting images etc. Hopefully will soon learn
  and successfully apply a lot more and be able to build nice looking websites.
</p>

<p>
  My short term goal is to be capable of creating good looking front ends for my
  own home automation projects, on the long term hopefully to create pages to
  other people as well.
